##### Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design

**Today's Progress**: Getting Coding Brain Active Again with BACK TO THE BASICS using Free Code Camp Challenges. I learned to create your own CSS properties by creating the value using -- `--penguin-skin: gray` and reference it for other properties `background: var(--penguin-skin)`

**Thoughts:** I really like the way Free Code Camp is set up to make me code. All coming back pretty quickly and remembering little tricks and stuff. This will be engrained in my brain!!!
